## First time install Instructions: ##
1) Download and extract the entire Zip. (Click green Code button, and select 'Download ZIP'.)
2) First, copy the contents of 0_ prefixed folder into your game directory (ex. C:<Steam Install Path/location>\steamapps\common\Valheim)
3) Launch the game one, once at the menu you can close the game.
4) Copy the contents of the 2_, 3_, 4_ into their respective named folders (ex. drop 2_plugins contents into <Above path>\BepInEx\plugins)
5) Launch game and connect to the server!

## Future Update instructions: ##
1) When a new addition is announced, navigate to new item(s) (Typically just a new Plugin, within 2_plugins)
2) There should be a button to 'Download' the file, click that. (Windows/Chrome may scream at you for downloading a .dll file, but can be ignored/skipped)
3) Place file into appropriate BepInEx folder as originally done.
